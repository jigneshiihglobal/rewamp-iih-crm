<p>Hi {{ $lead->firstname ?? '' }},</p>
<p>“If it isn’t broken, don’t try and fix it”.</p>
<p>This is a common phrase I heard in the UK when I first moved here.</p>
<p>It’s also something a lot of business owners say.</p>
<p>Trying to improve systems, or trusting some that can make your life better, can seem like a risk.</p>
<p><strong>As an entrepreneur, I totally get it.</strong></p>
<p>You’re making money. You’re paying your bills. Most importantly, you’re in a routine. You’re comfortable in the workflow.</p>
<p>I’ve found myself in the same situation several times with IIH Global.</p>
<p>Normally, those are the times when it's time to innovate, change perspectives and take things up a level.</p>
<p>In the past, when I’ve taken the jump to improve systems or process , here’s what I quickly realised:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> <strong>I overestimated</strong> how much hassle it would cause (my team created an app in a week that solved a workflow issue we were having).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> <strong>I underestimated</strong> how much time it would save me in the long run (like my client who spent years writing things by hand and now has a super fast app that saves him hours every week).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> I thought It was better to do X or Y tasks myself, really, I was just stuck in my ways. Letting go and allowing my team to build technology to help me <strong>unlocked the growth and my business in ways I couldn’t imagine.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re reading this, why is this important for you to understand?</p>
<p>Because creating your big idea or software solution is easier, cheaper and faster than you probably think.</p>
<p>Don’t go another day without taking the step to make your business run better, or to bring your business idea to life with an app.</p>
