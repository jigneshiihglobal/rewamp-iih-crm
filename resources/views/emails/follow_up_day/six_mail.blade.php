<p>Hi {{ $lead->firstname ?? '' }},</p>
<p>When I started IIH Global in 2013, most people didn’t think it would last.</p>
<p>I will admit, creating a software development agency in the UK isn’t for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>Clients compare our prices to prices around the world.</p>
<p>The technology that we started using is now out of date, and development agencies are expected to work faster and faster to keep up with the speed of modern business.</p>
<p>However, I’m now proud to say that IIH Global is now the number 1 choice for small to medium-sized businesses in the UK, and around the world.</p>
<p><strong>How? By creating partnerships.</strong></p>
<p>When we first started, I noticed that clients were unhappy with their previous agency. It was because they thought only about individual projects. The development agency would finish creating software or an app and say to their client “Here you go” and pass it over.</p>
<p>If the client came back with a bug or a change that needed to be made, it felt like the development agency had moved on to another project.</p>
<p><strong>They were on to the next client, problem or issue.</strong></p>
<p>I never saw it like that.</p>
<p>If you see your work in ‘projects’, then you aren’t thinking about the client behind the project. You’re thinking about solving a problem, and once the problem is solved, the project is complete.</p>
<p>For most agencies, the end of the project is the end of the journey.</p>
<p>As client’s, the creation of technology is the start of the journey.</p>
<p>Clients want technology that solves a real life problem in their business or lives. At IIH Global, we see ourselves as your technology partner. That means being there to make improvements, and sort out problems.</p>
<p>That’s whether you need something big or small.</p>
<p>It’s been a key driver of our success, because our clients see that we really care.</p>
<p>When IIH Global was first created, we took an interest in smaller projects that other agencies thought were beneath them.</p>
<p>They were obsessed with ‘big projects’, I cared more about creating long-term partnerships.</p>
<p>Lots of those small projects became clients that have stayed with us for over a decade. That’s why 80% of our client base have been with us for 5+ years.</p>
<p>Do you want a technology partner that works with your business for the long haul?</p>
