<p>Hi {{ $lead->firstname ?? '' }},</p>
<p>I got a few responses from the last email telling me that I shouldn’t talk badly about freelancers.</p>
<p>One email even said ‘You’re anti-freelancer’.</p>
<p>Here’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>I’m not anti-freelancer</strong></p>
<p>We’ve used freelance copywriters and designers on and off for years.</p>
<p>But at IIH Global, we don’t use any freelancers for client work.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>Relying on freelancers scares me.</strong></p>
<p>Putting all your trust into a single person who is (at best) a part-time employee isn’t a great business move.</p>
<p>They can miss deadlines, deliver poor quality work or simply not stick to the brief.</p>
<p>They simply aren't as invested as I or any permanent team member would be.</p>
<p>In order for you to trust us, we need to be confident we can deliver.</p>
<p>I feel 100x more confident we can deliver with our tried-and-tested permanent team than I would with freelancers.</p>
<p><strong>There’s another dimension to the ‘freelancer v company’ argument too</strong></p>
<p>Many of our early customers came to us after bad experiences with freelancers.</p>
<p>With a freelancer, you can feel like you are managing them. If you aren’t used to that, or simply don’t want to do that (who can blame you!), then it can be a difficult experience.</p>
<p>With a pro team like IIH Global, our clients trust us to manage deadlines and deliverables for them.</p>
<p>We create the feeling of a mutual partnership with a single point of contact (me), instead of dealing with a single person with opinions and problems.</p>
<p>Do you want a tech partner who you’ll be able to rely on long-term.</p>
<p>If so - let’s have a chat.</p>
