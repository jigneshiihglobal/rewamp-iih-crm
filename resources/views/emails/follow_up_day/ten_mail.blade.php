<p>Hi {{ $lead->firstname ?? '' }},</p>
<p>Developers like this are the worst.</p>
<p>You meet them, map out your vision, get the software, and you’re happy.</p>
<p>Here’s the truth.</p>
<p>You pay for it. The project was a success.</p>
<p><strong>Seems pretty good right?</strong></p>
<p>Not quite</p>
<p>Weeks or months go past.</p>
<p>You notice a bug. You want something changed. You forgot to mention something that you needed.</p>
<p>You email or call. No answer.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve fallen victim to the freelance developer</strong></p>
<p>You aren’t the first, you probably won’t be the last.</p>
<p>They might have done a good job, even a great job, but they misled you.</p>
<p>A development project isn’t a one-time thing, it’s an ongoing relationship. They led you to believe that it was a simple process of building the house and handing you the keys.</p>
<p>In this way, they are like bad builders.</p>
<p>They build you a great extension, but every day you notice that wonky door or weird bit on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>Just like the builder, when you call the developer, they are already on to their next job.</strong></p>
<p>They are knee-deep in a new project, and barely have time to answer your calls or emails.</p>
<p>If they do, it's to tell you that they can’t do anything until next June.</p>
<p><strong>That’s why IIH Global cares about partnerships, not projects.</strong></p>
<p>We aren’t on to the next job, we are there with you while you notice things you want changed.</p>
<p>Your software should grow as your business grows, and change and you change.</p>
<p>If you want to make a long-term commitment to your business, we are here to help.</p>
