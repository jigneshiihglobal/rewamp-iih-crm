<p>Hi {{ $lead->firstname ?? '' }},</p>
<p>If you were to look at our clients before and after working with us, here’s what you’d notice.</p>
<p>After we partner with businesses, they are 10x more scalable.</p>
<p>They can work with <strong>more clients, manage more employees and get more work done</strong> than before.</p>
<p>We help you build systems that scale using technology.</p>
<p>The internet would lead you to believe that most businesses use software and automation, but that’s not really true.</p>
<p>Even a lot of tech businesses rely on notepads, spreadsheets and (worst of all) memories.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with that, if you’re happy staying at the same size.</p>
<p>But, If you had to onboard 10 new employees tomorrow, would you be able to share the same notepad?</p>
<p>If you bring on multiple new clients this week, would you all share the same spreadsheet?</p>
<p>The answer is probably no.</p>
<p><strong>Technology is the key to scale</strong></p>
<p>In case you’re wondering, that isn’t just if you’re a tech business.</p>
<p>Some of our clients in catering, construction or real estate have found that they work 10x better with our custom technology.</p>
<p>We help them plug the gaps between the online and offline world.</p>
<p>So, what does this have to do with <i><strong>your</strong></i> business?</p>
<p>If you’re reading this and you want to unlock your limit to scaling, or to build your idea without worrying about having the backend system to grow with speed, let’s talk.</p>
<p>We act as your technology partner, oversee the building and maintenance of your dream.</p>
