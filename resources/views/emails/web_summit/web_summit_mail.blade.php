<p>Hello There,</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that IIH Global will be attending the Web Summit 2024, one of the biggest tech events in the world, next month. Our team will be on a business trip throughout Europe and the UK during this time, and we would love the opportunity to connect with you.</p>
<p>If you or someone from your company will be attending the Web Summit, we would be thrilled to meet you in person. It's a great chance to discuss potential collaborations and share insights about the latest trends in technology.</p>
<p>If you're not attending the event but have any ongoing projects or potential outsourcing needs, we would be happy to travel to your office to discuss how we can assist you. Our team is eager to explore synergies and find ways to support your business objectives.</p>
<p>Please feel free to reply to this email if you'd like to know more about our schedule or to arrange a meeting. We're looking forward to the possibility of connecting!</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Sanjay</p>
