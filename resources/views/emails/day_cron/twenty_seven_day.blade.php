<p>Hi {{ $lead->firstname ?? '' }},</p>
<p>Two reasons why people come to us:</p>
<ol>
    <li>They want something made from scratch. Usually a mobile app or software.</li>
    <li>Another company made something and doesn't want to stick around to fix it or continue to help them with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>We love helping our clients at every stage of their journey, but the second reason continually upsets us.</p>
<p>It seems like lots of development companies focus on  'projects' instead of 'relationships'.</p>
<p>Part of our mission is to grow with our clients.</p>
<p>That means that we help them every step of the way. A long-term relationship is good for business, but it's also good for our clients' businesses. That's why many of our clients has been with us for over a decade.</p>
<p>We have helped create the technology our clients need at every step of their journey.</p>
<p>We're here to help with the stuff that other development companies don't enjoy as much.</p>
<p>That sometimes means maintenance or improvement of existing systems and creating small solutions.</p>
<p>We're happy to do it.</p>
<p>For us, we believe helping you along the way is part of the journey.</p>
<p>Like any business, we want to grow.</p>
<p>But we must honour that we exist and thrive because of past and present customers. They are the reason for our success and help us feed our families.</p>
<p>Our clients satisfaction is what the team and I are proud to be a part of IIH Global.</p>
<p>Would you like us to help you bring your idea or solution to life?</p>
