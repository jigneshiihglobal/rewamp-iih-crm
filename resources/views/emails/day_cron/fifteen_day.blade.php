<p>Hi {{ $lead->firstname ?? '' }},</p>
<p>We're famous in the industry for this reason.</p>
<p>The '30 minutes or less promise'.</p>
<p>For our clients, we'll get back to you (between 9-5) within 30 minutes. Often, a lot less.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my last email, my clients often have my mobile number, so they can either text me or call me.</p>
<p>If you're sitting there thinking "Why does IIH Global do this?". I have a very good reason.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the origin of the '30 minutes or less promise'.</strong></p>
<p>When I first joined IIH Global as a developer, I was very proud of my UX and software development skills.</p>
<p>I knew every programming language and worked hard to stay at the cutting edge of making apps and websites.</p>
<p><strong>Like a lot of techy people, I was in my own world.</strong></p>
<p>After maybe 6 months, I started working on a big project. After a while, my boss asked me if I wanted to be the project manager. I was scared but didn't want to say no.</p>
<p>I liked the client, and we spoke often. In fact, the client (a rich businessman) told everyone that we were the best development agency in London.</p>
<p>At the time, we were a quarter of the size we are now.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what our client wrote in a review:</strong></p>
<p>"Most other agencies don't even answer my calls. They take my money, and I have to chase them for progress. IIH Global are like my partners with my business, they answer my call in 30 minutes or less".</p>
<p>We realised that great customer service was actually our biggest USP.</p>
<p>The '30 minutes of less' policy was born.</p>
<p>Speak Soon,</p>
<p>Sanjay.</p>
