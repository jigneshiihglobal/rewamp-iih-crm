<p>Hi {{ $lead->firstname ?? '' }},</p>
<p>In hospitality, it's important for teams to be in the right uniform at the right time.</p>
<p>We created a solution for Five Star Catering Staff, a US-based hospitality recruitment agency.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>The problem here was simple.</p>
<p>They didn't have a system to organise uniform inventory, orders, and delivery.</p>
<p>They were struggling to keep track of inventory, keep staff and clients up to date and run daily operations in an effective way.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Through close collaboration, we delved deep into understanding the business objectives, challenges, and processes of Five Star Catering Staff.</p>
<p>The outcome was a custom CRM solution that was integrated with their existing web and database infrastructure. We built bespoke functionalities tailored to streamline their uniform management. This solution included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A user-friendly interface for online uniform ordering</li>
    <li>Real-time tracking of order statuses and locations</li>
    <li>Efficient inventory management of uniforms and sizes</li>
    <li>Automated generation of reports and invoices for events and clients</li>
    <li>Custom notifications and reminders for staff and clients</li>
    <li>Easy updates for uniform data and images</li>
</ul>
<p>Completed in just 3 months, this custom platform went through ongoing testing and feedback to ensure scalability and adaptability.</p>
<p>Our partnership resulted in significant time and cost savings for Five Star Catering Staff and improved their customer satisfaction.</p>
