<p>Hi {{ $lead->firstname ?? '' }},</p>
<p>Here’s how we created software that is used in 7000+ Pharmacy stores in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Our client is Pharmsmart</strong></p>
<p>Pharmsmart is an electronic incident reporting software for Pharmacies. They sell their platforms and services to Pharmacies across the UK. It is created for pharmacists, by pharmacists.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>Pharmaceutical professionals have a huge amount of administrative and paperwork.</p>
<p>This takes time away from growing their teams.</p>
<p>It also prevents them from doing their greatest work, which is giving their patients the service that they need.</p>
<p><strong>Our solution</strong></p>
<p>We worked with Pharmsmart to create a suite of tools. Each tool was specifically designed to make the daily life of a pharmacist 10x easier.</p>
<p>This includes stock tracking, dispensary management and reporting to head office.</p>
<p>We designed these tools to be used by themselves or combined together. This allows pharmacists to pick and choose solutions based on their needs.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Pharmsmart receives 7000 daily views and is used by 20,000 pharmacists across the UK.</p>
<p>Pharmsmart have free trials so you can test the technology without risk, and long contracts.</p>
<p>Every software tool comes with a 6-month money-back guarantee.</p>
